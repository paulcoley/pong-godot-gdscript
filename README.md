This project is an implentation of Pong created using the Godot engine (v3.4.4) and written in GDScript to gain an understanding of the engine for future use.

To run the project, download a copy of Godot and import this project into the editor, then run or package and run.

This implementation has the elements of menu system, Player vs Player, and Player vs AI. It touches on collision detection and response, sound streaming, player input mapping via Godot's input system, the handling of singeltons and the interaction with the signal system.

By default, the left player uses the W and S keys for up down movement, and the right player usings the Up and Down keys. A victory screen will show up after 5 points are scored.
